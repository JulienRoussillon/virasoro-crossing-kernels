# virasoro-crossing-kernels

This Python code is in the Jupyter notebook format. It is verifying the main claims of the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09325.

More precisely, the goal of this Jupyter notebook is to verify numerically the fusion transformation of the four-point spherical conformal blocks for c<1. We also verify that the proposal for the fusion kernel at c>25 agrees with Ponsot and Teschner's integral formula. In this notebook we utilise the repository https://gitlab.com/s.g.ribault/Bootstrap_Virasoro developed by Sylvain Ribault to compute the conformal blocks and double Gamma functions.
